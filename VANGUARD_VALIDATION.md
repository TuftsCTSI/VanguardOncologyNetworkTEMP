# Process for Proposing, Specifying, and Validating Work within the Vanguard Development Group

## Process Overview

In general, we will aim to maintain a four-step workflow for developing and ratifying various oncology-related components within this subgroup, described in the subsections below. Specifically, this workflow will apply to the following component categories:

1. **Metadocumentation**: Like this document, or other information about the ways in which this group functions
2. **Oncology Work and Conventions**: Investigation, selection, and validation of conventions for representing oncology data in OMOP. Also includes gap analyses, ontology work, etc.
3. **Software Distribution, Validation, and Packaging**: Organization and distribution of existing and new oncology-focused tools and packages according to best practices for development
4. **Site Status Evaluation and Progress Tracking**: Generation of distributable queries, integrations between form submissions and a GH-based project view, etc.
5. **Use-Case Driven Implementation, Studies, Validation**: Development of study packages, network collaboration on research questions, etc.

### Proposal

In its simplest form, a proposal for a new component or task should exist as a GitHub issue (and subsequently, subissues). That issue should contain the following content:

1. Description of the need for the component, with links to potential use cases
2. Overview of work involved, and rough time estimates, to create the component
3. Description of potential impact in the event of a successful implementation
4. References to existing or tangential resources

### Specification and Development

Following the proposal, the small group will evaluate and assign outstanding tickets based on Vanguard priorities. If the proposal is prioritized for a given week, it enters a specification and developemnt stage where it becomes active in the project management space and its progress is tracked weekly.

All work, documentation and software development, should be transparent and linked to the associated issue(s) through linked commit messages, or comments with references within the issue.

### VG Validation

With a first version complete, the component can enter a validation phase. One advantage of the Vanguard group is that enables quicker iterations on validation beacuse of its smaller scope and targeted group members.

Validation will require some combination of the following processes and will prompt a decision-making moment in the broader VG group:
1. Implementation and testing of convention or software at multiple sites
2. Evaluation, review, and discussion of documentation or convention content
3. Review of potential impact and overall flexibility

If a component is validated, it will be flagged in the OHDSI OncologyWG space, and can move to broader ratification

### Ratification

Validated components stemming from Vanguard work will require ratification and update from the broader OHDSI community. We will work together with the OncologyWG to establish an efficient review and approval process that accounts for the various steps taken above.
